# 👋 Welcome to BlazeItJames' GitHub Profile!

- 👋 Hi, I’m @blazeitjames
- 👀 I’m interested in developing in Lua and playing FiveM. I like watching football, I’m into cars, and I enjoy the organization involved when making games.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about the FiveM server environment and improving my Lua skills. I’m also working on enhancing my team management and organizational skills.
- 💞️ I’m not actively looking to collaborate at this time, but if anyone is interested in helping develop a FiveM server, I’d be open to reviewing it.
- 📫 How to reach me: You can contact me on Discord at **eragamer**, via email at **imblazeitjames@gmail.com**, or on the cfx.re website under the username **eragamer**.
- 😄 Pronouns: He/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I’m a non-native Spanish speaker, and I previously created a Roblox game called Football Legends (formerly New Football Legends) that received over 7 million plays! I’ve also managed communities with up to 17,000 members in a single Discord server.
